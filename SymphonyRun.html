									<h1>Mystery Of Mina Koes<br />

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/MMK_VineMinigame.gif" alt="" /></span>The mystery of Mina Koes is a serious game I developed with my group as a part of my CMGT studies. For this serious game, we had to make a game that could get the youth to be interested in folk's tales. For this we had to do a lot of research as well as in person testing with the target audience in order to make the game as the client wanted it to be. My primary role in the team of this project was to be a programmer, but I also participated in the research and I animated some of the models in the game. In the end, the game featured a variaty of minigames as well as collectable clues. The player has to complete these minigames in order to be able to collect certain clues, as well as to gain access to certain parts of the map. If the player paid close attention to the clues and messages within those clues, the player could correctly select a suspect, If the player selects the correct suspect, the player is then transported to their house in order to discover more clues and eventually arrest the suspect and win the game. If the player however does not select the correct suspect, the game has it's historical ending where the suspect is not caught and only a lot later is the murder actually solved. In the game, may historically accurate items are used that are accurate to the time period, and a reference of where the original crime scene was, was used in order to make the map.</p>

It has also taught me a lot about research and working with the tools that you have. For this project, the client only had certain tablets and screens available for the game we made for them. This had a large impact on the way we made the game and on the design decisions made in regards to the UI and game as a whole.</p>
