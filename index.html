									<h2><a href="SAM_Simulator.html">Most Recent Project:<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>One of my most recent projects is called "SAM Simulator". In this project, as the name implies, the player plays as a SAM system operator! The SAM system the player is using is modelled afte rthe real-life MIM-23 SAM system. Im the game, everything is phyiscally modelled, the radar beam is a physical model, the radar screen accurately represents all the detected targets and their locations, and the missile has an actual flight model that is highly detailed. I am planning on finalizing and releasing this project later this year.<br />
